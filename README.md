# TODO

- Mobile
  - Top margin on first section of homepage is too big
- Does Stitch Fix Technology (or Engineering and Data Science) need to be in the top nav? At least after first section?
- Footer
  - link to stitchfix.com 
  - link to about page on stitchfix.com
- Blog
  - Author pages (all posts by an author, linked in bios)
  - Related posts list?
  - Next/previous post nav?
- Combined job list?
  - Separate nav item for combined job list?
- Bugfixes
  - following achor from another page scrolls to correct position
- Use Brandon font/new branding guidelines as on stitchfix.com?
