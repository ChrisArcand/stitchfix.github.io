      <h2 class="h4 sans-serif b">Communication Skills</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        You aren't just great at listening, speaking and writing. You are able to convey 
        complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 sans-serif b">Product-Centric Thinking</h2>
      <p  class="mb-2">
        You come from a technology background but you have opinions about how the product 
        you are building should work. You dig deep and work with customers and the company 
        to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 sans-serif b">Self-Directed</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Once you've got something, we don't have to worry about it. You have a bias toward 
        action.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 sans-serif b">Passion</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        You love what you do.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 sans-serif b">Just Generally Awesome</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless 
        of the circumstances. Extra points if we think you're funny.
