        Stitch Fix’s recommendation algorithms need to be rock-solid as the penalty for being wrong is very high.   As such, we need to explore innovative techniques in Statistics and/or Machine Learning to leverage even more of our rich data and expert knowledge. 
        </p>
  <h2 class="h3">What to expect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a paid internship for the summer of 2013.</li>
    <li>The hours are generally 9-5 M-F but there is flexibility.</li>
    <li>In this position, you will learn about real applications of data and algorithms for recommendation engines, marketing, operations, and merchandising/buying.</li>
    <li>At the end of the experience you will have the opportunity to present your work to the executive staff.   In addition, in some cases, you will have the opportunity to implement your solution and see it live (pending successful AB test).</li>
    <li>There also may be an opportunity to write an academic paper on the experience (pending content & approval).</li>
  </ul>
        <h2 class="h3">Potential Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying customer clusters (or product clusters or a combination)</li>
          <li>Regression optimization through Elastic Nets, Lasso, ...etc.</li>
          <li>Ensemble Methods to coalesce predictions from multiple models.</li>
          <li>Measures for model evaluation (variants of RMSE, accuracy, precision, pseudo r-squared, ...etc)</li>
          <li>We are open to other ideas.  What’s most important is that the interests of both the candidate and Stitch Fix are aligned.  Submit your proposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="h3">Desired Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PhD candidate in Statistics or CS/Machine Learning</li>
          <li>Proficient with statistical techniques: regression (elastic nets, lasso), support vector machines, decision trees, clustering, Bayesian classifiers, ensemble methods (random forest, bagging, boosting, … etc.)</li>
          <li>Experience in statistical analysis tools such as R, Weka, Julia, SAS, ...etc.</li>
          <li>Proficient in relational database basics: SQL, basic relational modeling, ...etc.</li>
          <li>Basic ability in a general coding language such as Python/Ruby/Java/C++/Perl</li>
        </ul>
