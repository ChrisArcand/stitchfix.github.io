  <p class="experience">
    We are a very rapidly growing start up company that's redefining how people buy 
    apparel by building a scalable, highly personalized eCommerce platform.  
    Up until now we have operated solely on our wits, our passion for building great 
    products, and our desire to succeed as a team and a company.  We are now at the 
    point that hiring a couple of great product managers will be critical in helping 
    the company get to the next level.

  <h2 class="h3">Product-Centric Thinking</h2>
  <p>
    You come from a technology background but you have opinions about how the product 
    you are building should work. You dig deep and work with customers and the company 
    to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Self-Directed</h2>
  <p>
    Once you've got something, we don't have to worry about it.  
    You have a bias toward action.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Passion</h2>
  <p>
    You love what you do.
    You spend some of your free time reading blogs/books, or going to meet ups.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Just Generally Awesome</h2>
  <p>
    You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstances. Extra points if we think you're funny.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Location</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    While our preference is for everyone to work in San Francisco, we will make a exception if you are an exceptional fit.
