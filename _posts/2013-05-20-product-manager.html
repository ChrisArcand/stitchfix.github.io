  <p>
    We are a very rapidly growing start up company that's redefining how people buy apparel by building a scalable, highly personalized eCommerce platform.  Up until now we have operated solely on our wits, our passion for building great products, and our desire to succeed as a team and a company.  We are now at the point that hiring a couple of great product managers will be critical in helping the company get to the next level.

    <li>Ensure that critical details of new products or changes to existing products are communicated</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="h3">We'd Like You to Have</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>  3-5 years experience managing a technology product</li>
   <li>  Outstanding written and verbal communication skills</li>
   <li>  the ability move effortlessly between thinking strategically and getting into the weeds</li>

  </ul>
  <h2 class="h3">Product-Centric Thinking</h2>
      <p>
        You come from a technology background but you have opinions about how the product you are building should work. 
        You dig deep and work with customers and the company to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Self-Directed</h2>
      <p>
        Once you've got something, we don't have to worry about it.  
        You have a bias toward action.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Passion</h2>
      <p>
        You love what you do.
        You spend some of your free time reading blogs/books, or going to meet ups.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h3">Just Generally Awesome</h2>
      <p>
        You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstances. Extra points if we think you're funny.
     </p>
    <h2 class="h3">Location</h2>
    <p>While our preference is for everyone to work in San Francisco, we will make a exception if you are an exceptional fit.<br /><br /></p>
