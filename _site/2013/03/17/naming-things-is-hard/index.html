    Naming things is hard. 
  &lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;   
    Naming things is hard. It&apos;s also, very important. The people who read your code later 
    (most likely, you) - will thank you. I don&apos;t write code with the goal of never having 
    to change it. I write it with the intention of being able to change it quickly and easily 
    in the future. Being able to quickly read/understand the code, will allow for this to be a 
    reality. The first step in this, is naming things well.
  &lt;/p&gt;  
  &lt;p&gt;
    When I&apos;m naming variables - I normally write them down (with an actual pen --gasp-- ), on 
    post-it notes and stick them to my monitor. Every hour or so I&apos;ll glance at them and 
    see what jumps out at me. Often times my most critical/constructive thoughts are within the first 4 
    seconds. When I don&apos;t do this, I invent a series of variable names that are tied for first 
    place in horribleness.
  &lt;/p&gt;   
  &lt;p&gt;
    variable_19, portW, curr, navCURR, currLeft, pos2, and one of my real gems... 
    to_do_changeLater.Those are actual variable names from slop that I have written. I named these variables in 
    haste. And now I have no idea what data they store. How could I expect anyone else 
    to have any semblence of a fucking clue what my shitty variables are storing behind their thick veiled walls. 
    Variable names like this are basically keeping secrets from the reader. Great variable names don&apos;t keep 
    secrets. They stand at the tops of mountains and broadcast to the world in big neon lights what they&apos;re up to.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Important points from other people:
    Variables are our first step in the notion of abstraction
  &lt;/p&gt;
