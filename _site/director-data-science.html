        <h3 class="position">Director of Data Science Engineering</h3>
        <article class="requirements">
        <p class="experience">

        Stitch Fix is all about data-driven retail.   Data and analytics are our lifeblood and we want you to build the ecosystem in which it flows.  All of the functional areas need analytics to operate –Marketing, Ops, Merch, Buying, and Engineering.  And, it needs to go well beyond reports and dashboards … it needs to be part of the workflow, inherent to processes and decision-making.<br /><br />

        The Director of Analytics Engineering will recruit and build a stunning team, establish the analytics data architecture, support the entire organization in their data needs, and partner with Engineering to design and build analytic applications. 
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4>The Basics</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>8+ years in analytics, business intelligence, data warehousing.</li>
        <li>Proven track record of recruiting and leading teams.</li>
        <li>BA, MS in CS, Stats, Math or similar quant-oriented field.</li>
        <li>Experience with analytics and business intelligence technologies (reporting, visualization, ETL, MPP Databases). We are more interested in a deep understanding of the fundamentals rather than expertise in any specific tool.</li>
        <li>Solid in relational databases &amp; SQL.</li>
        <li>Proficiency in controlled experiments (AB testing) is desired.</li>
        <li>
        Helpful scrappy tech skills - not required, but tend to make folks more effective, nimble, and autonomous: 
          <ul>
            <li>Coding: Python/Ruby/Java/C++/Perl</li>
            <li>Big Data/Hadoop:         hdfs concepts, mapreduce, pig, parallel computing …etc.</li>
            <li>NoSql dbs: Mongo, Cassandra, Hbase, …etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
        <h4>Differentiating Qualities:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Inspiring and visionary leader that talented analytics engineers would love to work for.   Possesses a keen intuition on team dynamics, motivations, and efficacy. </li>
          <li>Naturally instills confidence and trust in the functional leaders of the organization.  They think of the analytics leader as their “go to” guy/gal.</li>
          <li>Stellar communication in both the tactical day-to-day and in the articulation of long-term strategy.</li>
          <li>Ability to change and keep changing.  Technology is evolving     quickly – especially in analytics and Big Data.  What you build today will quickly become obsolete.  </li>
          <li>Comfortable with (or even “thrives in”) vague requirements.  You’ll be given the context – goals, priorities, hypotheses – from there we expect you to figure out, and contribute to, the solution.</li>
          <li>Astute in prioritization.   A remarkable ability to identify what needs to be done … and even more important, what can wait.</li>
          <li>Hands-on. You’ve still got it.  At least to some degree.   Skilled enough to stay nimble and retain that deep context that comes from staying close to technology, analytics, and the data.</li>
          <li>Love for aesthetics in visualization, data modeling, and conceptual design.</li>
        </ul>
