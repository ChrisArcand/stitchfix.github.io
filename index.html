      <h4 class="h4">Multiple application architecture</h4>
    </header>
    <p>There are no monoliths here. Each application in our platform has a clear and distinct purpose and all of them
      are built in house, primarily in Ruby. That means small, clean code bases with little technical debt and lots of
      flexibility. Often we use RabbitMQ to send messages about real-world events to other apps who decide for themselves
      whether or not to do something with it. This de-coupled architecture allows us to scale with ease and add or change
      components as needed. When it really makes sense we build RESTful API's for our services as well.</p>

      <h4 class="h4">We are the Product team</h4>
    </header>
    <p>We hire engineers with great Product instinct because we are also the Product team. We value practicality and
      efficiency over process and interface directly with stakeholders in the business. Building great software
      is a collaborative effort. The business knows we need to do more than just deliver features and trusts where we focus
      our time and effort.</p>

      <h4 class="h4">Deadlines are doomed to fail</h4>
    </header>
    <p>Starting a conversation with a due date dooms it to fail from the beginning. We don't believe deadlines get things
      done faster. Rather, they encourage stress, bad decisions, and technical debt. We still deliver a lot in a short period of
      time, but not because we burned ourselves out in the process.</p>

    <p>
      We use technologies like PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ along with various private Gems to tie
      them
      all together. We work from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely, and we use Heroku, GitHub, Google Hangouts
      and
      HipChat to help us build it all.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are looking for people who share our values. We like to move quickly and ship lots of code, but in a
      considered
      way. We use TDD, CI and an all-hands-on-deck approach to Pull Requests to ensure we can keep the pace up without
      stinting on quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      If any of us have a good idea for introducing a new technology or pattern then we go ahead and run an
      experiment.
      The debates don’t start until we have some real evidence to look at and since we avoid dogma and evangelism they
      tend to be short.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work closely with our internal partners (no product managers here!) and we assume that they know best about
      what they need to do their jobs. Our job is to solve business problems and some of our proudest moments come
      from
      solving those problems without a line of code.
