    <div class="content blurb">
      <p>There are no monoliths here. Each application in our platform has a clear and distinct purpose and all of them
      are built in house, primarily in Rails. That means small, clean code bases with little technical debt and lots of flexibility. We use
      RabbitMQ to send messages about real-world events to other apps who decide for themselves whether or not to do
      something with it. This de-coupled architecture allows us to scale with ease and add or change components as needed.</p>
      <p>All apps are continually tested and deployed with little process overhead. We value complete test coverage,
      continuous integeration, and automatic deployments.</p>
