    </header>
    <p>Stitch Fix is forging a new kind of business model and we have some of the best data alchemists to drive it. We
       are an ensemble of high caliber scientists and engineers with expertise ranging from physics, neuroscience, to
       mathematics who are curious thinkers with get-things-done built into their DNA. The data we work on, the results,
       and products are some of Stitch Fixâ€™s key ingredients.</p>

    <p>In this role you will build a data science platform that can reliably scale to the needs of our data scientists,
       algorithms developers, and growing business.   You will have the opportunity to guide the development and decision
       making at all layers of the data platform from compute infrastructure (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, Redshift), to frameworks
       designed to speed up and aid in algorithms development, to an api / micro-service layer designed to democratize data
       to everyone in the organization.</p>
