    The Data Science Engineering Team at Stitch Fix is where the machine learning algorithms that power the Stitch Fix platform collide with real world computing, and as Stitch Fix continuous its meteoric growth we are for people who will thrive in this space. <br/><br/>
    Everyday tasks in this team involve modeling structured and unstructured data, figuring out how to persist and retrieve these data structures at scale, building frameworks that will house our machine learning algorithms, building statistical models and predictive algorithms using standard ML libraries like scikit-learn, coming up with challenger algorithms to uncrown the incumbent (think Netflix competition), building a framework using pyData libraries like Pandas that makes it easy for anyone in the Data Science team to deploy challenger algorithms.
