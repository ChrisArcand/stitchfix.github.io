    You've been pivotal in building multiple products and have been around long enough 
    to develop    a Spidey Sense about most aspects of building complicated pieces 
    of technology.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Communication Skills</h2>
  <p>
    You aren't just great at listening, speaking and writing.

    situation
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Product-Centric Thinking</h2>
  <p>
    You come from a technology background but you have opinions about how the product

    to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.

    if you are an exceptional fit.
