    <p>
	Stitch Fix is growing its mobile presence and we're looking for great engineers to help us build a great mobile app.  
	As a foundational member of the mobile team you'll have the benefit of working on a greenfield project with no legacy code to support.
	Stitch Fix is a different kind of company where we think the people actually doing the work are the ones who are best suited to decide what to build.
	As such, we donâ€™t have a product management discipline.  We expect our engineers to make critical decisions around product development.
	If the idea of being a key member of our mobile team excites you, then apply now!
