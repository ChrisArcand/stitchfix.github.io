  <h2 class="h3">The Company:</h2>
  <p>
  StitchFix is one of the most successful and innovative new ecommerce businesses.  We are a <a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups/">Full-Stack Startup</a>. We’re not a tech company with a purely tech product, and we’re not a traditional retail business with some tech awkwardly bolted on the side. We are true equal partners with the merchandisers, the stylists, the client services team, the operations team, the analysts and the marketers, as important to the success of the company as they are, but no more. 
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, we are highly trusted by the entire company because we deliver on what we promise and because we are completely transparent about our successes and failures - and this is a fast growing startup so that plenty of those!
</p>
<h2 class="h3">Here’s how our software is changing retail:</h2>
<p>
  Running our huge warehouse operations
  <ul>
    <li>We receive lots of deliveries from vendors every day and need to get them into our physical and digital inventory as quickly as possible</li>
    <li>We need to pick, pack and ship lots of Fixes every day, and they all need to be of the highest quality</li>
    <li>We get lots of returns from clients every day (it’s part of the business model) and we have to check the merchandise and get it back into inventory as quickly as possible</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Managing all of our merchandising
  <ul>
    <li>We have to order lots of new inventory every day and synchronize those orders with the warehouse</li>
    <li>We have to plan every upcoming week, month, season and year to ensure we have the right amount and best mix of clothes</li>
    <li>We have to leverage all of our sales and client data to make the best possible buying decisions</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Helping our stylists leverage our very effective styling algorithm to put together incredible, unique fixes for all our clients
  <ul>
    <li>Our stylists need to see the best possible matches between each client and all our clothes, and they need to use that information with their own knowledge to create a unique fix for each of our customers</li>
    <li>We need to give our stylists and their managers insight into their performance and success rates</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Supporting our customers to give them the best service we can
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage our customers to give us feedback about all aspects of our service through whichever channels they want, and we need to keep track of all of that</li>
    <li>We want our service to be as convenient as possible and sometimes that means lending a helping hand with shipments, payments or using our website</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  We use technologies like PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ along with various private Gems to tie them all together. We work from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely, and we use Heroku, GitHub, Google Hangouts and HipChat to help us build it all.
</p>
<p>
  We are looking for people who share our values. We like to move quickly and ship lots of code, but in a considered way. We use TDD, CI and an all-hands-on-deck approach to Pull Requests to ensure we can keep the pace up without stinting on quality. 
</p>
<p>
  If any of us have a good idea for introducing a new technology or pattern then we go ahead and run an experiment. The debates don’t start until we have some real evidence to look at and since we avoid dogma and evangelism they tend to be short.
</p>
<p>
  We work closely with our internal partners (no product managers here!) and we assume that they know best about what they need to do their jobs. Our job is to solve business problems and some of our proudest moments come from solving those problems without a line of code. 
</p>


<h2 class="h3">The Role:</h2>

<p>
  So far in the life of Stitch Fix our requirements for Dev Ops has been:
  <ol>
    <li>something that allows us to stand up new apps and roll out new features as quickly and easily as possible</li>
    <li>something that is robust and fault-tolerant</li>
    <li>something that does not need full-time Dev Ops staff</li>
  </ol>
  We have been growing rapidly and it now it seems 1 and 2 are conflicting with 3.
</p>
<p>
  Stitch Fix engineering serves the company as a whole by giving it the tools it need to run one of the most innovative e-commerce businesses in the world, without the company needing to know the details. That’s how we envisage the Stitch Fix Dev Ops team - providing the engineering team the tools to work as they want to, without them having to know the nitty gritty (although they will probably want to).
</p>
<p>
  We’re looking for a Lead Dev Ops Engineer who can support our growing engineering team and quickly move us towards an infrastructure that is not so reliant on platforms-, databases- and other -as-a-services, but still takes full advantage of the Cloud. You will designing the next phase of our infrastructural growth and will implement it in as seamless a way as possible.
</p>
<p>
  You will create a highly robust system that can support our five major Ruby on Rails apps with very different performance needs (and several minor ones), handle rapid growth and limit exposure to single points of failure. The system's health and performance will be monitored closely and in a transparent way so that the entire company can see how well it is performing.
</p>
<p>
  You will create tools to support the software engineers, tools that make it easy for them to roll out new code and test out new features. The tools will be flexible enough to support the various technologies we use and make it simple to add in new ones for experimentation and production purposes.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to all the technology you will build and support you will work towards building a Dev Ops team that you are excited about leading and mentoring.
</p>
<p>
  Here is what we currently use:
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>Private Gems</li>
    <li>Heroku</li>
    <li>Postgres</li>
    <li>Redis</li>
    <li>ElasticSearch</li>
    <li>RabbitMQ</li>
    <li>HipChat</li>
    <li>Hubot</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>CircleCI</li>
    <li>Airbrake</li>
    <li>Pingdom</li>
    <li>PagerDuty</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This is working just fine for us for now, but we want you to take us to the next stage in our growth and beyond.
</p>
<p>
