  <h2 class="h3">The Company:</h2>
  <p>
  StitchFix is one of the most successful and innovative new ecommerce businesses.  We are a <a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups/">Full-Stack Startup</a>. We’re not a tech company with a purely tech product, and we’re not a traditional retail business with some tech awkwardly bolted on the side. We are true equal partners with the merchandisers, the stylists, the client services team, the operations team, the analysts and the marketers, as important to the success of the company as they are, but no more. 
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, we are highly trusted by the entire company because we deliver on what we promise and because we are completely transparent about our successes and failures - and this is a fast growing startup so that plenty of those!
</p>
<h2 class="h3">Here’s how our software is changing retail:</h2>
<p>
  Running our huge warehouse operations
  <ul>
    <li>We receive lots of deliveries from vendors every day and need to get them into our physical and digital inventory as quickly as possible</li>
    <li>We need to pick, pack and ship lots of Fixes every day, and they all need to be of the highest quality</li>
    <li>We get lots of returns from clients every day (it’s part of the business model) and we have to check the merchandise and get it back into inventory as quickly as possible</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Managing all of our merchandising
  <ul>
    <li>We have to order lots of new inventory every day and synchronize those orders with the warehouse</li>
    <li>We have to plan every upcoming week, month, season and year to ensure we have the right amount and best mix of clothes</li>
    <li>We have to leverage all of our sales and client data to make the best possible buying decisions</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Helping our stylists leverage our very effective styling algorithm to put together incredible, unique fixes for all our clients
  <ul>
    <li>Our stylists need to see the best possible matches between each client and all our clothes, and they need to use that information with their own knowledge to create a unique fix for each of our customers</li>
    <li>We need to give our stylists and their managers insight into their performance and success rates</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Supporting our customers to give them the best service we can
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage our customers to give us feedback about all aspects of our service through whichever channels they want, and we need to keep track of all of that</li>
    <li>We want our service to be as convenient as possible and sometimes that means lending a helping hand with shipments, payments or using our website</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  We use technologies like PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ along with various private Gems to tie them all together. We work from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely, and we use Heroku, GitHub, Google Hangouts and HipChat to help us build it all.
</p>
<p>
  We are looking for people who share our values. We like to move quickly and ship lots of code, but in a considered way. We use TDD, CI and an all-hands-on-deck approach to Pull Requests to ensure we can keep the pace up without stinting on quality. 
</p>
<p>
  If any of us have a good idea for introducing a new technology or pattern then we go ahead and run an experiment. The debates don’t start until we have some real evidence to look at and since we avoid dogma and evangelism they tend to be short.
</p>
<p>
  We work closely with our internal partners (no product managers here!) and we assume that they know best about what they need to do their jobs. Our job is to solve business problems and some of our proudest moments come from solving those problems without a line of code. 
</p>


  <h2 class="h3">The Role:</h2>
  <p>
    We are looking for an experienced full-stack engineer who has built a couple of full Rails applications and has some other MVC framework experience. You want to learn from an experienced development team and develop your own skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may not have much hands-on product management experience but it’s something you are keen to learn because you love talking to your clients about what you can build for them. You are interested in how StitchFix works as a business, not just in the technology, and you would like a chance to make it work even better.
  </p>
  <p>
Here are some more specifics about what we’re up to:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced learning algorithms to aid our awesome styling team</li>
      <li>Multiple-application architecture running in the cloud.</li>
      <li>Custom warehouse and inventory systems for a very unique business model</li>
      <li>Responsive web interfaces to drive both the customer experience and our internal tools</li>
      <li>Building prediction models for a smart and successful future</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 class="h3">We get excited about engineers who have the following:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Real tech fluency:</strong> You can build anything with anything, and you probably have 5+ years software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication skills:</strong> You aren’t just great at listening, speaking, and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. </li>
      <li><strong>Product-Centric Thinking:</strong> You have opinions about how the product you’re building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Directed:</strong> Once you’ve got something, we don’t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn’t have QA, Project Managers, or Product Managers so we take ownership of what we build.</li>
      <li><strong>Passion:</strong> You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions with a GitHub repository or personal project page or blog.</li>
      <li><strong>Just Generally Awesome:</strong> You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if you’re already a Stitch Fix superfan! </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bonus points for:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experience working collaboratively as a team. We use GitHub, Heroku and HipChat to get stuff done both online. We’re agnostic about what technologies you’ve used and are more interested in the processes you prefer.</li>
      <li>Experience working with testing and continuous integration. We're working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests,  CircleCI and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.</li>
      <li>Experience using pull requests to create rapid prototypes and demonstrate new features.</li>
      <li>Unique ways to automate and get things done. If you’ve created a Ruby gem to complete a task in your projects, tell us about it! :)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2 class="h3">Here’s what we offer:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Competitive salaries and generous equity.</li>
      <li>A business that trusts and embraces tech.</li>
      <li>A senior team that does things right.</li>
      <li>A startup with a proven business model that’s growing fast.</li>
      <li>Use your preference of tools and hardware.</li>
      <li>A comprehensive health insurance plan, including full dental and vision coverage.</li>
      <li>Fully stocked pantry with your choice of snacks and drinks</li>
      <li>Sunny office in downtown San Francisco and also in downtown Pittsburgh (or you get to visit our SF office once every 2 months if you prefer to work remotely) </li>
  </ul>
