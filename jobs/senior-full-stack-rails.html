    <p>
      We are looking for an experienced full-stack engineer who has built a couple of full Rails applications or has
      some other MVC framework experience. You want to learn from an experienced development team and develop your own
      skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not have much hands-on product management experience but itâ€™s something you are keen to learn because you
      love talking to your clients about what you can build for them. You are interested in how Stitch Fix works as a
      business, not just in the technology, and you would like a chance to make it work even better.
