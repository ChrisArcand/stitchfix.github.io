      <p>At Stitch Fix, our goal is to help our customers look great and feel great about themselves by revolutionizing how people shop. In a time-starved world where shopping often feels overwhelming, our business connects customers to clothes they love. Whether it's helping someone dress for success at a new job or taking the stress out of packing for a family vacation, we fix clients' closets – and they love us for it!</p>

      <p>We've built unique, innovative software for merchandising, warehouse and inventory management, remote styling, and logistics. We leverage vast amounts of client data to make decisions throughout the company. All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our clients and a very successful business. We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we're looking for incredible people to contribute!</p>

      <h4 class="h4">About the Product Design Team</h4>
    </header>
      <p>
        Our design roles are oriented around user experiences, not platform. The Product Design team supports four major platforms: customer, styling, merchandising, and warehouse. We initiate and support cross-product projects. Stitch Fix has a user-centered culture and we help surface user research to the teams who use it to make decisions. The team is currently small, so we're looking top-notch designers to help us shape UX process within the company.
