      <h4 class="h4">The Opportunity</h4>
    </header>
      <p>
Shopping for clothes is broken. Going to stores is time-consuming and often fruitless. Online shopping is mind-numbing, and it’s difficult to know if the style or size of an item is right. Underneath it all, we purchase clothes because we want to look good and feel good about how we look. In a time-starved world where no-one is helping us achieve this goal, there is a huge opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
      Stitch Fix is built from the ground up to solve this problem. Our service is deeply personal and permanently changes how people shop. We have unique, innovative platforms for remote styling, merchandising, warehouse and inventory management, and logistics. We leverage vast amounts of client data at key decision points throughout the company. All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our clients and a very successful business, and we believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity!

    </header>
      <p>
      We work closely with teams across the company. Our job is to solve business problems.  We partner from strategy through delivery.  Our most valuable asset is the trust of the people for whom we build products.  We identify and deliver the highest value technology investments, and protect our ability to deliver that value over the long term.  Some of our proudest moments come from solving business problems without writing a line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
      We like to move quickly and ship lots of code, but in a considered way. We use techniques like automated testing and continuous deployment.  We occasionally pair but not often.  We believe in using whatever tools, processes, and products are pragmatic and get the job done.  Some technologies you are likely to find here include Rails, iOS, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch RabbitMQ, Heroku, GitHub, Blue Jeans, Screen Hero, and HipChat
