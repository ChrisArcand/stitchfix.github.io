      <p>
Shopping for clothes is broken.  Going to stores is time-consuming and often fruitless.  Online shopping is mind-numbing, and itâ€™s difficult to know if the style or size of an item is right.  Underneath it all, we purchase clothes because we want to look good and feel good about how we look.  In a time-starved world where no-one is helping us achieve this goal, there is a huge opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
Stitch Fix is built from the ground up to solve this problem.  Our service is deeply personal and permanently changes how people shop.  We have unique, innovative platforms for remote styling, merchandising, warehouse and inventory management, and logistics. We leverage vast amounts of client data at key decision points throughout the company.  All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our clients and a very successful business.
      </p>
      <p>
We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity.  We are looking for an amazing leader to help us take it to the next level, specifically around our client experience.  In addition to extending and improving from where we are, there are a number of dramatic opportunities this leader would spearhead. Some examples we are excited about include launching completely new services for our clients, reinventing how we capture data from our clients and a number of big upgrades to our one-of-a-kind Styling Platform.
